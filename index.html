      <p>Hi, my name is Rifa Syed. In 2016 I graduated from California State University, Long Beach with a Bachelor's in Psychology. I originally wanted to go to medical school but have also always wanted to learn computer programming so my hope for the future is to be able to merge the two. In my free time, well I don't do much because I don't have a lot of it but in the rare moments that I do I like to binge on Netflix as well as play with my two cats. I am a makeup fanatic and I use makeup as a creative outlet using myself and others as canvases. I am very excited to learn how to code and looking forward to the future.</p>
